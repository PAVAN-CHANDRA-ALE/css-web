            A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked
            together via cryptographic hashes.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous
            block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are
            represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created.
            Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare
            linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently,
            blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot
            be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.
